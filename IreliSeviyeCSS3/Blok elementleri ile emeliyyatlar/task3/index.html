        <h1>Currency control in practice</h1>
        <p>How to get money for services from foreign clients</p>
    </div>
    <div class="first-paragraph">
        <p>I am a programmer, I develop websites. In November 2018, I was approached by a German startup. We discussed the terms and agreed that they would transfer the payment in dollars to me on check. Before that, I had never worked with foreign exchange. I thought the client would just make a regular bank transfer to my card. It turned out, before the money can be used, it must go through currency control.</p>

        <h2>What is currency control</h2>
        <p>In Russia, all foreign exchange transactions are subject to the Law on Foreign Exchange Regulation and Foreign Exchange control. From buying currency in an exchange office to making settlements with foreign companies - all this foreign exchange transactions, and they must be accounted for by the state.</p>
        <p>When a payment comes from abroad, the Government and the Central Bank must be sure that the money obtained legally. They ask the recipient for documents that will confirm that he received payment for a legal product or service, and not for the sale of weapons, organizing a terrorist attack or illegal deal. The process of verifying the legality of the money received is called foreign exchange control.</p>
        <p>To speed up currency controls, the Central Bank allows commercial banks to check the legality of payments. Employees of the bank that received the payment check all confirming documents, and then transfer all information to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
